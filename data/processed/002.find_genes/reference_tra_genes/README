1. ncbi_metadata.tsv: 
Metadata obtained by directly querying NCBI using accession ids of records in the tra homolog reference database from Jana data/raw/references/tra_reference_genes_db.fasta. 
This specific file was generated by joining old_ncbi_accession_annnotations.tsv and new_ncbi_accession_annnotations.tsv. 

Here is a description of the columns: 
OldAccessionVersion: old accession id of the protein sequence before reannotation project NP... or YP...
ReplacedBy: new non-redundant accession id WP..... All identical sequences given the same id. 
Organism_old: Description of old host organism using old accession id 
Title_old: You get the idea
SubTypeSubName
Organism_new
Title_new
Status: Whether the record has been suppressed or not. 

2. ncbi_metadata_genes.tsv	
Has additional column with gene names from Title_new in ncbi_metadata.tsv. Only genes that were specifically in the 5ShadesofF paper were searched for. 	

3. tra_ref_genes_metadata_combined.tsv Combined metadata from both the fasta record headers (data/raw/references/tra_reference_genes_db_metadata.tsv) and by directly querying NCBI (data/processed/ncbi_metadata_genes.tsv)

4. tra_ref_genes_metadata_nodup.tsv
Duplicate protein ids (identical sequences) were removed from tra_ref_genes_metadata_combined.tsv. The sequence kept simply was the first occurrence of that sequence in the database. Went from 1924 records to 982 records.

5. tra_ref_genes_metadata_nodup_manual.tsv 
Cases with no gene name in tra_ref_genes_metadata_nodup.tsv were manually annotated based on description of protein from headers and titles. 

6. tra_ref_genes_metadata_nodup.fasta [FINAL]
All the protain sequences of the 979 records in tra_ref_genes_metadata_nodup.tsv. No duplicates. Occurences of genes "orf1", "vagd" and "proq/fino" kept. 

7. all_protein_ids_tra_ref_genes_metadata_nodup.txt
All the protein ids (old and new) of the 982 records in tra_ref_genes_metadata_nodup.tsv. Useful for querying NCBI. 3 more than fasta records probably because 3 of the fasta records could not be retrieved. 

8. tra_ref_genes_metadata_nodup_manual_v1.tsv [FINAL]
From tra_ref_genes_metadata_nodup_manual.tsv, added a column containing all the protein ids (old and new). 982 records. Occurences of genes "orf1", "vagd" and "proq/fino" kept.

9. TRA_GENES_LABEL
Includes functional labels and short form labels of 36 transfer genes. The functional labels come from Koraiman et al. 2018. 19.09.24: Changed functional label of trag to "T4SS" from "self-transfer prevention" as this reflects its main role in the conjugation process.
